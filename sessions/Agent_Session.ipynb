Accelerating Preclinical and Clinical Trial Design:**\n*   **What's new:** AI can optimize clinical trial design by identifying the most suitable patient populations, predicting trial outcomes, and even designing adaptive trials that can be modified in real-time based on incoming data. It can also help in selecting optimal dosing regimens.\n*   **Impact:** Leads to faster, more efficient, and potentially more successful clinical trials.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n*   **What's new:** AI is proving highly effective at scanning vast databases of existing drugs and their known mechanisms to identify those that could be **repurposed for new indications**. This is a much faster and less expensive route to new therapies.\n*   **Impact:** Can bring existing, safe drugs to new patient populations much quicker.\n\n**6. AI in Small Molecule and Biologics Discovery:**\n*   **What's new:** While early AI efforts often focused on small molecules, there's a growing application of AI in the discovery and design of **biologics**, such as antibodies, peptides, and even mRNA-based therapeutics. This includes predicting protein structures and optimizing their binding affinities.\n*   **Impact:** Expands the AI toolkit to a wider range of therapeutic modalities.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Initiatives making waves:**\n\nMany biotech startups and established pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI for drug discovery. Some prominent names often mentioned in this space include:\n\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on AI-driven design of novel molecules.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Leverages AI and automation for drug discovery and development.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Uses AI to analyze scientific literature and data to identify drug targets and candidates.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its generative AI platforms for drug discovery.\n*   **NVIDIA:** While not a drug discovery company itself, their GPUs and AI platforms are foundational for much of the AI research in this field.\n\n**Key \"New\" Aspects to Watch For:**\n\n*   **Integration of multiple AI modalities:** Combining generative AI with predictive AI and natural language processing for a more holistic approach.\n*   **Increased use of real-world evidence (RWE):** AI analyzing RWE from electronic health records, wearables, etc., to inform drug discovery and clinical trial design.\n*   **Focus on \"undruggable\" targets:** AI's ability to explore more complex biological mechanisms and design molecules for challenging targets.\n*   **AI for precision medicine drug development:** Designing drugs tailored to specific patient subgroups based on their genetic profiles.\n\nThe field is moving so quickly that what is \"new\" today could be standard practice in a year or two. The overarching trend is that AI is no longer just a tool to *assist* drug discovery; it's becoming an **integral partner in the creative and predictive process** itself.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development I mentioned: Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**. This is a critical area where AI is truly transforming drug discovery by helping scientists understand *what* diseases are caused by and *what* biological mechanisms can be targeted to treat them.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into this development:\n\n**The Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nTraditionally, identifying a new drug target has been a painstaking and often serendipitous process. It involves:\n\n*   **Understanding disease biology:** Deciphering the complex molecular pathways and genetic alterations that lead to a disease.\n*   **Identifying key players:** Pinpointing specific proteins, genes, or pathways that are critically involved in the disease process.\n*   **Validating the target:** Confirming that by modulating this target (e.g., inhibiting a protein or activating a gene), you can actually have a therapeutic effect without causing unacceptable side effects.\n\nThis process can take years, even decades, and many promising leads fail because the initial target wasn't as central to the disease as initially thought.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns and connections within massive, complex datasets that would be impossible for humans to process. In target identification, AI is used in several ways:\n\n1.  **Analyzing \"Omics\" Data:**\n    *   **Genomics:** AI can scan through millions of genetic variations (SNPs, mutations) and correlate them with disease incidence, progression, and severity. It can identify genes that are upregulated or downregulated in diseased tissues.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** Analyzing RNA expression patterns to understand which genes are actively being transcribed and translated into proteins in different cell types and disease states.\n    *   **Proteomics:** Studying the proteins present in cells or tissues, as proteins are often the direct targets of drugs. AI can identify proteins that are abnormally expressed or modified in disease.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** Analyzing the small molecules (metabolites) in biological samples to understand metabolic pathways that are disrupted in disease.\n\n2.  **Leveraging Biomedical Literature and Databases (NLP):**\n    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is used to \"read\" and understand vast amounts of scientific literature, patents, and clinical trial data.\n    *   AI can extract relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and potential therapeutic interventions, uncovering hidden connections and hypotheses.\n    *   This helps researchers stay updated on the latest findings and identify emerging targets that might be overlooked.\n\n3.  **Network Biology and Systems Pharmacology:**\n    *   Diseases are rarely caused by a single faulty component; they arise from disruptions in complex biological networks.\n    *   AI can model these intricate networks (e.g., protein-protein interaction networks, signaling pathways) and predict how perturbing one node (a target) will affect the entire system.\n    *   This allows for a more systems-level understanding of disease and helps identify targets that are crucial \"hubs\" in the network.\n\n4.  **Predicting Target Druggability and Efficacy:**\n    *   Once potential targets are identified, AI can further refine the selection by predicting:\n        *   **Druggability:** How likely is it that a small molecule or antibody can bind to and modulate this target?\n        *   **Therapeutic Window:** What is the likelihood of achieving a therapeutic benefit versus causing toxicity?\n        *   **Biomarker Identification:** Are there measurable indicators (biomarkers) that can be used to identify patients who are most likely to respond to a drug targeting this specific mechanism?\n\n**Impact of AI in Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Accelerated Discovery:** AI significantly shortens the time it takes to go from a broad understanding of a disease to identifying a specific, validated target.\n*   **Novel Targets:** AI can uncover targets that are not obvious through traditional methods, including those that are \"undruggable\" by conventional means.\n*   **Reduced Risk:** By improving the validation process, AI helps to reduce the number of drug candidates that fail in later stages of development due to a poorly chosen target.\n*   **Precision Medicine:** AI's ability to analyze patient-specific data allows for the identification of targets that are relevant to particular subgroups of patients, paving the way for more personalized therapies.\n\n**What's Next/Trending:**\n\n*   **Integration of multi-omics data:** Combining data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc., in more sophisticated AI models to get a holistic view.\n*   **Causal inference:** Moving beyond correlation to AI models that can infer causal relationships between biological factors and disease.\n*   **AI for rare diseases:** Applying AI to the limited but often detailed data available for rare diseases to identify novel targets.\n\nIn essence, AI is transforming target identification from a laborious, often reactive process into a more systematic, predictive, and hypothesis-generating endeavor, which is fundamental to developing new and effective medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  When we talk about companies involved in AI-driven target identification and validation, it's a broad landscape.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
